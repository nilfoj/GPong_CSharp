<h1> 🎾 Game:FootPong </h1>

#
## 📚 Description
<p>
This project is a recreation of the classic Atari game "Pong", originally released in 1972. This was my first game developed using the Godot and C# tools. The main motivation behind the project was to deepen my knowledge of the game development process, paving the way for the creation of more complex applications in the future.
